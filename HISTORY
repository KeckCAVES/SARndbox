The Augmented Reality Sandbox History
=====================================

SARndbox-1.0:
- Initial release, needs Vrui-2.4 to build.

SARndbox-1.1:
- Added constant water evaporation rate to sandbox.

SARndbox-1.2:
- Adapted code to APIs of Vrui-2.7 and Kinect-2.5.
- Changed types of all size variables to unsigned int.

SARndbox-1.3:
- Fixed projector calibration code.
  - Fixed normalization of calibration homography.
  - Fixed calculation of projected z value for z buffering.
  - Now properly handles non-orthogonal Kinect views.

SARndbox-1.4:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-3.0-001.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-2.7.
- Fixed a mistake in step 5 of the installation instructions in the
  README file; measurement points must be taken in zig-zag order, not
  counter-clockwise. It's still wrong in the calibration video.
- Updated instructions in README file according to new calibration
  utility.

SARndbox-1.5:
- Made non-target blobs yellow in CalibrateProjector to make it easier
  to distinguish the target blob (green).

SARndbox-1.5-001:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-3.1-001.
- Fixed texture border mode bug that caused blue lines to run around the
  water simulation area.
- Fixed bug that prevented water from running out of the sandbox sides.
- Added hysteresis option to input filter to further remove jitter in
  the reconstructed surface. Triggered by -he <hysteresis envelope>
  command line option.

SARndbox-1.6:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-3.1-004.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-2.8.
- Added tool class to pause/unpause topography updates.
- Added water simulation control dialog to change water speed, number of
  simulation steps, and water velocity attenuation dynamically.
- Added links to tutorial videos to README.
- Adapted instructions in README to improved calibration procedure and
  added notes about new full-screen toggle key combination (Win+f).
- Added command pipe to override some configuration values from outside
  of running SARndbox process; pipe name passed by -cp <pipe name>
  command line option. Current commands:
  - waterSpeed <speed>
  - waterMaxSteps <max steps>
  - waterAttenuation <attenuation>
  - colorMap <color map name>

SARndbox-2.0:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-4.0-001.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-3.0.
- Complete restructuring of SARndbox modules.
- New rain maker based on hand detection.
- New DEM tool.
- Changed several command line parameters to have enable/disable
  versions, such as -nhm ("no height map") to disable height mapping,
  and -uhm ("use height map") to enable height mapping. See online help
  for the full list of parameters.
- Preliminary support for per-window rendering settings when multiple
  windows are used. -wi <window index> applies all following rendering-
  related settings to the window of the given index.
- Added overall scale factor to sandbox to simulate different terrain
  sizes; the previous fixed scale, which is now the default scale, was
  100.0 (1:100, 1cm in sandbox is 1m in virtual terrain).

SARndbox-2.1:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-4.1-001.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-3.1.
- Support for all 3D cameras supported by the Kinect-3.1 package.
- Support for multiple display windows with individual rendering
  settings.
- Improvements to DEM tool.

SARndbox-2.2:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-4.2-001.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-3.2.
- Added tool to save the current surface as a DEM file.
